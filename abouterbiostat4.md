The E-learning system for the cluster statistical modeling (II) is focused on survival analysis. Two courses are available: Introduction to Survival analysis using R  (Developed by Roel Braekers with R examples of Alessio Crippa) and Survival analysis using R (developed by David Harrington). 

*   **Introduction to Survival analysis using R** (See [Survival analysis I](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Statistical%20modeling%20(2)/Survival%20Analysis%20using%20R)).

The course covers the following  topics in survival analysis:

   + Censoring.
   + Estimation of the survival function.
   + Life tables and Kaplan-Meier estimator.
   + Comparison of survival curves.
   + Test for two or more samples.
   + Log-rank test, tests for trend and stratified tests.
   + Cox's regression model and stratifed proportional hazards.
   + Time-dependent covariates.
   + Survival distributions and parametric regression models in survival analysis.
   + Accelerated failure time regression models


*   **Survival Analysis using R** (See [Survival analysis II](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Statistical%20modeling%20(2)/Survival%20analysis%20using%20R%20-II)).

The course covers the following topics in survival analysis:

   + Introduction and background.
   + Non-parametric estimation of a survival distribution.
   + Significance tests with censored data.
   + Proportional hazards regression: basics.
   + Proportional hazards regression: special topics.
   + Designing a survival study.
