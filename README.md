# The >eR-Biostat initative
## Making R based education materials accessible for all

The E-learning system, developed as a part of the **>eR-Biostat**  initiative, offers free online course materials for under graduate and master students in biostatistics/statistics in developing countries. For each course, the materials are publicly available and consist of several types of course materials: 
* Notes for the course.
* Slides for the course.
* R programs, ready to use, which contain all data and R code for the all examples and illustrations discussed in the course.
* Homework assignments.
* Example of exams.

# Available courses:
The courses are organized in three clusters.  **Introductory courses** that do not aim to cover new topics in statistics (at a master level) but to train new master students to use R for data analysis. The course cluster **Under graduate courses** provide courses in intermediate level and a basic level in statistics is required  in order to follow the courses. The courses within this cluster can be also use as training courses  for non statisticians and as courses to support R usage in unde graduate program in biostatistic/statistics. The course clusters **Core (I)** and **Core (II)** consist of basic and advanced courses, respectively. 

## Introductory courses
* Introduction to R (https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Introductory%20Courses/Introduction%20to%20R)

## Online or Off-line?
Some courses developed for this initiative were developed as online courses while other as off line courses.   In both cases, all course materials can be download and used in the class.
