# Making R based education materials accessible for all xxx

One of the main problems in high education at both under graduate and master levels in developing countries is the lack of high quality , **R based**,  materials for courses in education programs.  The **>eR-Biostat**  initiative is focused on education programs (both undergraduate and master) in Biostatistics/Statistics and for non-statisticians and aim to develop new E-learning system for courses at different education level.


Courses are organized in four clusters and ready to be delivered in class. The **Introductory courses** aim to train students in data analysis using R at a basic level. These courses were developed for undergraduate students, both non statisticians and statisticians. The courses within this cluster can also be used as courses to support R usage in undergraduate program in biostatistics/statistics. The course cluster **Basic courses** provides courses at intermediate level and a basic knowledge in statistics is required in order to follow the courses. The courses within this cluster can be used as training courses for non-statisticians and as courses to support R usage in undergraduate programs in biostatistics/statistics. The course clusters **Statistical modelling (I)** and **Statistical modelling (II)** consist of basic and advanced courses at a master level in biostatistics/statistics, respectively.
