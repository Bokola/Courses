# The >eR-Biostat initative
# Longitudinal data analysys (LDA) using R

The course covers statistical tools and methods used to analyze data collected on the same group of individuals on multiple occasions over time. 
Mixed models are a modern powerful data analysis tool to analyze longitudinal data, typically arising in studies where the levels of a factor 
are a random selection from a wider pool, or in the presence of a multi-level nested structure with different levels of variability. 
The course illustrates medical and health-related applications of mixed modelling, such as multi-center trials, cross-over trials, and the analysis of repeated measures. 
The course focuses on the linear mixed model, assuming normally distributed data, and on how to fit it and interpret its results.
