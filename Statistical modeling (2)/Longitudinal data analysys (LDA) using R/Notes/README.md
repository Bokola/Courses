## Notes for the course “Longitudinal data analysis (LDA) using R”
As notes for the course, we recommend to read the paper by Bates et al. (2015) “Fitting Linear Mixed-Effects Models Using lme4”. The paper contains information about the practical implementation of LMM in R using the lme4 R package. The datasets used in the paper for illustration are a part of the lme4 package.
