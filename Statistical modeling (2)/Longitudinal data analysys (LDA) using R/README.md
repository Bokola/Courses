# The >eR-Biostat initative
# Longitudinal data analysis (LDA) using R

The course covers statistical tools and methods used to analyze data collected on the same group of individuals on multiple occasions over time. 
Mixed models are a modern powerful data analysis tool to analyze longitudinal data, typically arising in studies where the levels of a factor 
are a random selection from a wider pool, or in the presence of a multi-level nested structure with different levels of variability. 
The course illustrates medical and health-related applications of mixed modelling, such as multi-center trials, cross-over trials, and the analysis of repeated measures. 
The course focuses on the linear mixed model, assuming normally distributed data, and on how to fit it and interpret its results.

This course focuses on the analysis of longitudinal data with continuous and categorical outcome variables. Step by step, we will be developing longitudinal data analysis techniques by extending the well-known multiple linear regression model for studies with repeated observations on the same respondents. This will result in the presentation of the mixed effects model (also known as multilevel model, random-effects model, hierarchical linear model, ...), allowing the analysis of change over time.
Throughout the course lectures, the emphasis will be on understanding the why and how of these models by explaining the underlying theory of these multilevel analyses using lots of examples. The application and interpretation of outcome of these techniques will be demonstrated in R.
