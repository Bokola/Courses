## Basic concepts in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and computational statistics

This course presents the basic concepts in EDA and computational statistics. The course can be given as a  two-days workshop or as a course of 3-4 classes (3 hours per class).  Topics (all presented at a basic level) covered in the course include:

* Basic Exploratory data analysis in R (Location, Spread, Resistance and Robustness). The course covers selected chapters from the book “Understanding robust and exploratory data analysis” by David C. Hoaglin, Frederick Mosteller and John W. Tukey (Editors): 
  + Chapter 3: BOXPLOTS AND BATCH COMPARISON
  + Chapter 10: COMPARING LOCATION ESTIMATORS: TRIMMED MEANS, MEDIANS, AND TRIMEAN
  + Chapter 11: M-ESTIMATORS OF LOCATION: AN OUTLINE OF THE THEORY

* Computational statistics (Basic bootstrap, Likelihood and basic optimization). For the basic bootstrap, the course covers chapters from the book  “An Introduction to the Bootstrap” by B. Efron and R. Tibshirani:
  + Chapter 4: The empirical distribution function and the plug-in principle 
  + Chapter 5: Standard errors and estimated standard errors 
  + Chapter 6 The bootstrap estimate of standard error

Homework assignments and an example of an exam are NOT available as a part of the course but practical sessions are included at the end of each chapter.
