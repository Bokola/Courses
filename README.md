One of the main problems in high education at a master level in developing countries is the lack of high quality course materials for courses in master programs. The **>eR-Biostat**  initiative is focused on masters programs in Biostatistics/Statistics and aim to develop new E-learning system for courses at a master level.

The E-learning system, developed as a part of the **>eR-Biostat**  initiative, offers free online course materials for master students in biostatistics/statistics in developing countries. For each course, the materials are publicly available and consist of several type of course materials: (1) notes for the course, (2) slides for the course, (3) R programs, ready to use, which contain all data and R code for the all examples and illustrations discussed in the course and (4) homework assignments and exams.

The **>eR-Biostat** initiative introduces a new, R based, learning system, the multi-module learning system,  in which the students in the local universities in developing countries will be able to follow courses in different learning format, including e-courses taken online and a combination between e-courses and local lectures given by local staff members. R software and packages are used in all courses as data analysis tool for all examples and illustrations. The **>eR-Biostat**  initiative provides a free, accessible and ready to use tool for capacity building in biostatistics/statistics for local universities in developing countries with current low or near zero capacity in these topics. In its nurture, the R community is used for this type of collaboration (for example, CRAN and Bioconductor which offer access to the most up-to-date R packages for data analysis). The **>eR-Biostat**  initiative is aimed to bring the R community members for the development of high education courses in the same way it is currently done in software development.
