Biclustering in a GUI & Growing a GUI together!
-----------------------------------------------



### Introduction

We are happy to announce the first release of the **BiclustGUI** on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcmdrPlugin.BiclustGUI/){:target="_blank"} (`RcmdrPlugin.BiclustGUI`)!
This GUI will you enable to quickly try out a wide arrange of biclustering algorithms and produce some helpfull graphs in order to explore your data. Since we made the choice of developing it in the form of a plug-in for R Commander, you can save your R code after the session which can be used without GUI intervention. However for those of you who love using Shiny, have no fear! We have also created a Shiny App including all the biclustering algorithms and the most interesting plots. (For all available diagnostics and graphs, you will have to head over to the BiclustGUI package itself though.)
