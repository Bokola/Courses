This course cluster is focused on basic statistical modeling and consists of 4 courses at a master level: Practical linear models using R,  GLM using R, Analysis of Binary Data and log linear models using R and Bayesian Analysis. All courses will be avilable online during the acedemic year 2017/2018.

*  **Categotical Data Analysis:**
The course has two parts: modeling binary data and log linear models. 

*  **Modelling Binary Data using R** (See [Binary Data](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Statistical%20modeling%20(1)/Modelling%20Binary%20Data%20using%20R)).

The course covers topics from the books of David Collett *Modelling Binary Data* and Alan Agresti *An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis*. The course consists of 3 classes, each of three hours and combines theory and application using R. Topics covered in the course include:

       Comparing Proportions in Two-by-Two Tables.
       The Relative Risk and the Odds Ratio.
       Chi-Squared Tests of Independence.
       Analysis of I X J tables.
       Logistic Regression: model formulation, interpretion, estimation and inference.
       Model Selection.
       
* **Log linear models using R**
   
* **Applied Generalized Linear Models (GLM) using R** (See [GLM](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Statistical%20modeling%20(1)/glm)).

The course covers topics discussed in

* Collet D (1994): Modeling Binary data.
* Lindsey (1997): Applying generalized linear models.
* Dobson (2002): An introduction to generalized linear models.
* McCillagh and Nelder (1983): Generalized linear models (first edition).

Topics include in the course: 

    
    Linear  models with normal error.
    Generalized linear models.
    Exponential Family
    Generalized linear model function in R
    Models for Binary data.
    Estimation, confidence intervals and Inference.
    Model Selection and Model diagnostic.
    Poisson regression and log linear models.
    Beyond Poisson and binomial distributions: models with different link functions and/or       
    distributions.
    Over dispersion.


*   **Practical linear models using R**
