# The >eR-Biostat initiative
## Making R based education materials accessible for all

## Introductory courses
This group of courses are developed at an introductory level. Only basic level knowledge of statistics is required. These courses were developed for undergraduate students, both non statisticians and statisticians. The courses within this cluster can also be used as courses to support R usage in undergraduate program in biostatistic/statistics.
