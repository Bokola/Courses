# The >eR-Biostat initative
## Making R based education materials assessable for all

The E-learning system, developed as a part of the **>eR-Biostat**  initiative, offers free online course materials for master students in biostatistics/statistics in developing countries. For each course, the materials are publicly available and consist of several types of course materials: 
* Notes for the course.
* Slides for the course.
* R programs, ready to use, which contain all data and R code for the all examples and illustrations discussed in the course.
* Homework assignments and exams.

# Available courses:
The courses are organized in three clusters.  **Introductory courses** that do not aim to cover new topics in statistics but to train new master students to use R for data analysis. The course clusters **Core (I)** and **Core (II)** consist of basic and advanced courses, respectively. 

## Introductory courses
