This course cluster is focused on basic statistical modeling and consists of 4 courses at a master level: Practical linear models using R,  GLM using R, Analysis of Binary Data and log linear models using R and Bayesian Analysis. All courses will be avilable online during the acedemic year 2017/2018.


-   **Modelling Binary Data using R** (See [Binary Data](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Statistical%20modeling%20(1)/Modelling%20Binary%20Data%20using%20R)).

The course covers topics from the books of David Collett *Modelling Binary Data* and Alan Agresti *An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis*. The course consists of 3 classes, each of three hours and combines theory and application using R. Topics covered in the course include:

       Comparing Proportions in Two-by-Two Tables.
       The Relative Risk and the Odds Ratio.
       Chi-Squared Tests of Independence.
       Generalized Linear Models for Binary Data (an introduction).
       Logistic Regression: model formulation, interpretion, estimation and inference.
       Model Selection
  
-   **log linear models using R**

-   **Practical linear models using R**

-   **Applied Bayesian modeling**
