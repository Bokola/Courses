-   **Introduction to R** (See [R](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Introductory%20Courses/Introduction%20to%20R)).

This course is an introductory course to R and can be given as a two-days workshop or as a course of 3-4 classes (3 hours per class). All topics in the course are presented at a basic level and do not intend to introduce new statistical materials. Only a limited knowledge in R is required. 

-   **Simple linear regression using R** (See [Regression](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Introductory%20Courses/Introduction%20to%20statistical%20modeling%20using%20R/Simple%20linear%20regression)).

This course covers the topic of simple linear regression using the R function lm(). Topics (all presented at a basic level) covered in the course include: (1) introduction and model formulation, (2)
fitting a simple linear regression model using the lm() function in R, (3) model diagnostic and (4)
model diagnostic in R.

-   **One-way ANOVA using R** (see [ANOVA](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Introductory%20Courses/Introduction%20to%20statistical%20modeling%20using%20R/One%20way%20ANOVA))

This course covers the topic of one way ANOVA models using the R function aov(). Topics (all presented at a basic level) covered in the course include: (1) the one-way ANOVA model, (2) sources of Variability, (4) One-way ANOVA using R: the aov() function, (5) model formulation and hypotheses testing, (6) model diagnostic in R: normal probability plot and (7) multiple testing.

-   **Logistic Regression using R** (see [Logistic regression](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Introductory%20Courses/Introduction%20to%20statistical%20modeling%20using%20R/Logistic%20regression))

This course covers the topic of simple logistic regression using the R function glm(). Topics (all presented at a basic level) covered in the course include: (1) Introduction and example tour, (2)
fitting a simple linear logistic regression model using the glm() function in R, (3) model formulation and (4) interpretation of the model parameters.
