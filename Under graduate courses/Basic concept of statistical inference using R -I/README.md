# The >eR-Biostat initative
## Basic concept in statistical inference using R (I)

This course presents the basic concepts of  hypothesis testing (for single comparison and multiple comparisons)
This is an **online** course which was developed by Marc Lavielle within his initiative **statistics in action with R** (http://sia.webpopix.org/). The course structure:
## Single comparison
* Introduction
* Student’s t-test
  + One sample t-test
  + One sided test
  + Two sided test
  + Confidence interval for the mean
  + Two samples t-test
  + What should we test?
  + Assuming equal variances
  + Assuming different variances
  + Power of a t-test
*  Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test
* The limited role of the p-value
* Equivalence tests
  + Introduction
  + Two samples test
  + The TOST procedure
  + Difference testing versus equivalence testing
  + One sample test

## multiple comparisons
* Introduction
* Distribution of the p-values
  + Introduction
  + Single comparison between 2 groups
  + A single comparison… among many others
  + The Bonferroni correction
  + Permutation test
* Controlling the False Discovery Rate
  + Detecting associations
  + A Monte Carlo simulation

All course materials are available online in
