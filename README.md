# The >eR-Biostat initative
## Making R based education materials accessible for all

The E-learning system, developed as a part of the **>eR-Biostat**  initiative, offers free online course materials in statistics in all education level, non statisticians, undergraduate and master students in biostatistics/statistics in developing countries. The materials for the courses, that are publicly available, consist of several types: 

The E-learning system, developed as a part of the **>eR-Biostat**  initiative, offers free online course materials in statistics in all education level, non statisticians, undergraduate and master students in biostatistics/statistics in developing countries. The materials for the courses, that are publicly available, consist of several types: 

* Notes for the course.
* Slides for the course.
* R programs, ready to use, which contain all data and R code for the all examples and illustrations discussed in the course.
* YouTube tutorials.
* Homework assignments.
* Example of exams.

# Available courses:

The courses are organized in four clusters.  The **Introductory courses** that aim to train users in data analysis **using R**  at a basic level. These courses were developed for undergraduate students, both non statisticians and statisticians.. The courses within this cluster can also be used as courses to support R usage in undergraduate program in biostatistic/statistics. The course cluster **Basic courses** provides courses  at intermediate level and a basic knowledge in statistics is required  in order to follow the courses. The courses within this cluster can be also use as training courses  for non-statisticians and as courses to support R usage in under graduate program in biostatistic/statistics. The course clusters **Statistical modeling (I)** and **Statistical modeling (II)** consist of basic and advanced courses at a master level in biostatistics/statistics  respectively.

## Online or Off-line?
Some courses developed for this initiative were developed as online courses while other as off line courses.   In both cases, all course materials can be download and used in the class.
