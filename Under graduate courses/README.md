# The >eR-Biostat initiative
## Making R based education materials accessible for all

## Undergraduate courses
This group of courses are developed at an undergraduate level. Only basic level knowledge of statistics is required at the beginning of the course. The courses  aim to teach the student basic topics in inference (hypothesis testing), modeling (regression) and basic ideas in exploratory data analysis and computational  statistics.

## Available courses in this module:
* Basic concepts in exploratory data analysis -EDA- and computational statistics: https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Under%20graduate%20courses/Basic%20concepts%20in%20exploratory%20data%20analysis%20-EDA-%20and%20computational%20statistics 
* Basic concepts of statistical inference using R (I):
