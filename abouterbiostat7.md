Advance knowledge in both statistics and R is required at the beginning of the courses.  Students are expected to be familiar with hypothesis testing and stimation, distrubution functions and basic concepts in probabilityd. 

*   **Sample size calculation using R** (See [Sample size](
https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Inference/Sample%20Size)).

The course covers selected topics sample size calculaion inclusing one and two sampe tests, linear and generelized inear models.

*   **Basic concepts in statistical inference using R**

The course covers selected chapters from the book of Efron and Tibshitani ‘’an introduction to the bootstrap’’. Topics covered in the course include: basic bootstrap, bootstrap estimation of the standard error, bootstrap confidence intervals, resampling based inference (bootstrap and permutation), bootstrap application for liner and generalized linear models.
