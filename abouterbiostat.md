Introductory courses
--------------------

-   **Introduction to R** (See [R](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Introductory%20Courses/Introduction%20to%20R)).

This course is an introductory course to R and can be given as a two-days workshop or as a course of 3-4 classes (3 hours per class). All topics in the course are presented at a basic level and do not intend to introduce new statistical materials. Only a limited knowledge in R is required. 

-   **Simple linear regression using R** (See [Regression](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Introductory%20Courses/Introduction%20to%20statistical%20modeling%20using%20R/Simple%20linear%20regression)).

This course covers the topic of simple linear regression using the R function lm(). Topics (all presented at a basic level) covered in the course include: (1) introduction and model formulation, (2)
fitting a simple linear regression model using the lm() function in R, (3) model diagnostic and (4)
model diagnostic in R.

-   **One-way ANOVA using R** (see [ANOVA](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Introductory%20Courses/Introduction%20to%20statistical%20modeling%20using%20R/One%20way%20ANOVA))

This course covers the topic of one way ANOVA models using the R function aov(). Topics (all presented at a basic level) covered in the course include: (1) the one-way ANOVA model, (2) sources of Variability, (4) One-way ANOVA using R: the aov() function, (5) model formulation and hypotheses testing, (6) model diagnostic in R: normal probability plot and (7) multiple testing.

-   **Logistic Regression using R** (see [Logistic regression](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Introductory%20Courses/Introduction%20to%20statistical%20modeling%20using%20R/Logistic%20regression))

This course covers the topic of simple logistic regression using the R function glm(). Topics (all presented at a basic level) covered in the course include: (1) Introduction and example tour, (2)
fitting a simple linear logistic regression model using the glm() function in R, (3) model formulation and (4) interpretation of the model parameters.

Basic courses
-------------

-   **Linear Regression using R** (See [linear regression](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Basic%20courses/Linear%20Regression%20using%20R)).

This course presents the basic concepts of linear regression. This is an online course which was developed by Marc Lavielle within his initiative *statistics in action with R* (http://sia.webpopix.org/). All R code for the examples presented in the course is avilable online. Slides which cover most of the materails presented in the course are avilable.

-   **Basic concept in statistical inference using R (I): single comparison**(See [Basic Inference(I)](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Basic%20courses)).

This course presents the basic concepts of hypothesis testing for single comparison. This is an **online** course which was developed by Marc Lavielle within his initiative *statistics in action with R* (http://sia.webpopix.org/). R code for all examples illustrated in the course is available online. In addition, slides and YouTube tutorials are available in the repositories of the course.

-   **Basic concept in statistical inference using R (II): multiple comparisons** (see [Basic Inference (II)](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Basic%20courses))

This course presents the basic concepts of hypothesis testing multiple comparisons. Itis an online course which was developed by Marc Lavielle within his initiative statistics in action with R (http://sia.webpopix.org/). R code for all examples illustrated in the course is available online. Slides will not be avilable in September 2017

-   **Basic concepts in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and computational statistics** (see [EDA](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Basic%20courses))

This course presents the basic concepts in EDA and computational statistics. Basic Exploratory data analysis in R (Location, Spread, Resistance and Robustness). The course covers selected chapters from the book “Understanding robust and exploratory data analysis” by David C. Hoaglin, Frederick Mosteller and John W. Tukey (Editors).In addtion, the course covers topics related to computational statistics (Basic bootstrap, Likelihood and basic optimization). For the basic bootstrap, the course covers chapters 4-5-6 from the book “An Introduction to the Bootstrap” by B. Efron and R. Tibshirani.

Statistical modeling (1)
-----------------------

-   **Modelling Binary Data using R** (See [Binary Data](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Statistical%20modeling%20(1)/Modelling%20Binary%20Data%20using%20R)).

The course covers topics from the books of David Collett *Modelling Binary Data* and Alan Agresti *An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis*. The course consists of 3 classes, each of three hours and combines theory and application using R. Topics covered in the course include:

  + Comparing Proportions in Two-by-Two Tables.
  +  The Relative Risk and the Odds Ratio.
  + Chi-Squared Tests of Independence.
  + Generalized Linear Models for Binary Data (an introduction).
  + Logistic Regression: model formulation, interpretion, estimation and inference.
  + Model Selection
