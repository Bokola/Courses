# Applied Generalized Linear Models (GLM) using R 

The course consists of 5-6 classes, each of three hours and combines theory and application using R. Topics covered in the course include:

*   Analysis of Variance
*   Linear regression models with normal error.
*   Generalized linear models.
*   Exponential Family
*   Generalized linear model function in R
*   Models for Binary data.
*   Estimation and confidence intervals.
*   Inference.
*   Model Selection.
*   Model diagnostic.
*   Poisson Regression.
*   Beyond Poisson and binomial distributions: models with different link functions and/or distributions.
*   Poisson regression and log linear models.
*   Over dispersion.
*   Special topic (I): Estimation of the prevalence and force of 16.  infection from current status data.
*   Special topic (II): Growth data.
