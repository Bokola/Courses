This group of courses is focused on statistical inference and it is developed at an master level in statistics. Advance knowledge in both statistics and R is required at the beginning of the courses.  Students are expected to be familiar with hypothesis testing and stimation, distrubution functions and basic concepts in probability. 

*   **Sample size calculation using R** (See [Sample size](
https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Inference/Sample%20Size)).

This course presents methods for sample size calculation using R. The course is developed at a master level by Martin Otava. R code for all examples included  in the course is available online. In addtion, slides and YouTube tutorials are avilable in the repositories of the course. The course contents:

      +  Power.
      +  Efect size.
      +  Visualization.
      +  Sample size calculation for normal distributed endpoints.
      +  Liner regression and ANOVA.
      +  Generelized linear models:
      +  Binary data.
      +  Poisson distribution.
      +  Survival analysis.
      +  Correlated data and Longitudinal data.
All theoretical topics are illustared using examples in R.



*   **Basic concept in statistical inference using R (I): single comparison**(See [Basic Inference(I)](https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Basic%20courses/Basic%20concepts%20of%20statistical%20inference%20using%20R%20-I)).

This course presents the basic concepts of hypothesis testing for single comparison. This is an **online** course which was developed by Marc Lavielle within his initiative *statistics in action with R* (http://sia.webpopix.org/). R code for all examples illustrated in the course is available online. In addition, slides and YouTube tutorials are available in the repositories of the course. This course can be used as an introductory course for the other course in this cluster. 

*   **Basic concepts in statistical inference using R**: the course will be avilable by the end of 2018,
