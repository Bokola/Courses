This group of courses is focused on statistical inference and it is developed at an master level in statistics. Advance knowledge in both statistics and R is required at the beginning of the courses.  Students are expected to be familiar with hypothesis testing and stimation, distrubution functions and basic probability. 

*   **Sample size calculation using R** (See [Sample size](
https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Data%20Analysis/Exploratory%20multivariate%20data%20analysis%20using%20R)).

The course covers selected topics in multivariate data analysis such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Correspondence Analysis (CA),Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) Cluster analysis and Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA). Both slides and YouTube lectures are available.

*   **Basic concepts in statistical inference using R**

The course covers selected chapters from the book of Efron and Tibshitani ‘’an introduction to the bootstrap’’. Topics covered in the course include: basic bootstrap, bootstrap estimation of the standard error, bootstrap confidence intervals, resampling based inference (bootstrap and permutation), bootstrap application for liner and generalized linear models.
