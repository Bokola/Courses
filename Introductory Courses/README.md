# The >eR-Biostat initative
## Making R based education materials assessable for all

## Introductory courses
This group of courses are developed at an introductory level. Only basic level knowledge of statistics is required. The courses **DO NOT** aim to teach the student new topics in statistics but to train the students to use R in data analysis.

## Available courses in this group:
* Introduction to R (https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Introductory%20Courses/Introduction%20to%20R).
* Basic concepts in exploratory data analysis and computational statistics in R (https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Introductory%20Courses/Basic%20concepts%20in%20exploratory%20data%20analysis%20and%20computational%20statistics).
* Introduction to statistical modeling using R (will be available online in 2018).
