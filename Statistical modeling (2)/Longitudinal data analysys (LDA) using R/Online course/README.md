## Basic concept in statistical inference using R (I): linear mixed effects models

This online course presents the basic concepts of  linear and nonlinear mixed models using R. 
This is an **online** course which was developed by Marc Lavielle within his initiative **statistics in action with R** (http://sia.webpopix.org/).  
R code for all examples illustrated in the course is available online. 

The course structure:

* Introduction
  + The orthodont data
  + Fitting linear models to the data
* Mathematical definition of a linear mixed effects models
* Statistical inference in linear mixed effects models
* Fitting linear mixed effects models to the orthodont data
* Some examples of models and designs
 + One factor (or one-way) classification
 + Two factors block design
