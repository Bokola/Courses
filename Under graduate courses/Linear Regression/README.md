## Linear Regression

This course presents the basic concepts of linear regression and ANOVA. This is an **online** course which was developed by Marc Lavielle within his initiative **statistics in action with R** (http://sia.webpopix.org/). The course structure:
Introduction

* Fitting polynomial models
  +  Fitting a polynomial of degree 0
  +  Fitting a polynomial of degree 1
  +  Numerical results
  + Some diagnostic plots
  + The predictive performance of the model
  + Confidence interval and prediction interval
  + Fitting a polynomial of degree 2
  +  Fitting a polynomial without intercept
  +  Using orthogonal polynomials
* Model comparison
  + t-test
  + Analysis-of-variance (anova)
  + Likelihood ratio test (LRT)
  + Information criteria
* Data transformation
  + log based tranformations
  + Diagnostic plots
  + Confidence interval and prediction interval
  + Model comparison
