This group of courses is focused on statistical inference and it is developed at an master level in statistics. Advance knowledge in both statistics and R is required at the beginning of the courses.  Students are expected to be familiar with hypothesis testing and stimation, distrubution functions and basic concepts in probability. 

*   **Sample size calculation using R** (See [Sample size](
https://github.com/eR-Biostat/Courses/tree/master/Inference/Sample%20Size)).

This course presents methods for sample size calculation using R. The course is developed at a master level by Martin Otava. R code for all examples included  in the course is available online. In addtion, slides and YouTube tutorials are avilable in the repositories of the course.
