## Basic concept in statistical inference using R (I): single comparison

This course presents the basic concepts of  hypothesis testing for single comparison. 
This is an **online** course which was developed by Marc Lavielle within his initiative **statistics in action with R** (http://sia.webpopix.org/).  R code for all examples illustrated in the course is available online. Slides will be avilable in September 2017.
