# Making R based education materials accessible for all
# What is all about ?
One of the main problems in high education at both under graduate and master levels in developing countries is the lack of high quality , **R based**,  materials for courses in education programs.  The **>eR-Biostat**  initiative is focused on education programs (both undergraduate and master) in Biostatistics/Statistics and for non-statisticians and aim to develop new E-learning system for courses at different education  level.

# Our approach
We believe that accessibility to free high quality education materials is crucial to ensure a high standard in education.  We offer an “open sources”, R based, education materials in statistics. Everybody (teachers and students) can download and use the courses from free.  

# Why R based new E-learning system ?

The **>eR-Biostat** initiative introduces a new, R based, learning system, the multi-module learning system,  in which the students in the local universities in developing countries are be able to follow courses in different learning format, including e-courses taken online and a combination between e-courses and local lectures given by local staff members. R software and packages are used in all courses as data analysis tool for all examples and illustrations. The **>eR-Biostat**  initiative provides a free, accessible and ready to use tool for capacity building in biostatistics/statistics for local universities in developing countries with current low or near zero capacity in these topics. In its nurture, the R community is used for this type of collaboration (for example, CRAN and Bioconductor which offer access to the most up-to-date R packages for data analysis). The **>eR-Biostat**  initiative is aimed to bring the R community members for the development of high education courses in the same way it is currently done in software development.
